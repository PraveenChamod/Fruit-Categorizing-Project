# Fruit_Detection_System
As a result of using non-technological systems and lack of new technological systems, the following disadvantages will be affected for the entire system of the company.

1. Mainly this process depends on manpower, within this covid 19 pandemic situation, they canâ€™t use manpower as they need. That is a huge effect on the Economy. 
2. And also, With the Manpower we can maximum work only about 8-10 hour per day. That is a big negative situation which affects the company's efficiency. 
3. Also with the current process, it may be an effect for wasting time and money compared with the automated system.

### Solution

- We have decided to develop an automated system of fruit detection application using MATLAB. With this Pandemic situation, automated systems are giving a lot of advantages. 
* Under this System, fruits would be categorized based on their Size, Color, Shape, and Quality Of the surface of the product.

## Project Development
In this pandemic situation due to lack of manpower, companies have faced many difficulties such as the affecting economy and fulfilling customer needs on time. As a result, most companies are moving forward with modern technology. They pay much attention to using more technical items to do their entire process. It gives more advantages compared with using manpower. With this situation, we hope our automated application will give a lot of comfort to their productivity in different ways. As well, we assume this application can be developed with various paths and various technologies for many fields.
